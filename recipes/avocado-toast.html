    <p>We're going back to basics this summer, <strong>so let's talk about avocado toast!</strong> Creamy avocado spread onto well-toasted bread is one of my favorite quick meals. Actually, it's one of my favorite meals in general. It's <em>so</em> delicious, I'd call it one of life's simplest pleasures.</p>
    <p>As usual, I have some <em>strong opinions</em> on what makes the best avocado toast. So today, I thought I'd share my basic recipe, with my best tips and favorite variations.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 slice of bread (I like thick-sliced whole-grain bread best)</li>
        <li>½ ripe avocado</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Optional: Any of the extra toppings suggested in this post</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast your slice of bread until golden and firm.</li>
        <li>Remove the pit from your avocado. Use a big spoon to scoop out the flesh. Put it in a bowl and mash it up with a fork until it's as smooth as you like it. Mix in a pinch of salt (about ⅛ teaspoon) and add more to taste, if desired.</li>
        <li>Spread avocado on top of your toast. Enjoy as-is or top with any extras offered in this post (I highly recommend a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt, if you have it).</li>
    </ol>
